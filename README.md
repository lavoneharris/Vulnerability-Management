<h2>Description</h2>
This Vulnerability Management Lab consits of using a the platform Nessus Essentials to monitor a virtual environment on Windows 8 & 10 system and performing credntialed vulnerbilty scans against the Windows 8 & 10 VM Host. Once the Vulnerbaility Assement is complete on the sandboxed network we will look to use the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle of Discover,Prioritize,Assess,Report,Remediate, and Verify to ensure there are no vulnerabilites.

<br />

<h2>What is Vulnerability Management:</h2>


<h2>Vulnerability Management Lifecyle:</h2>
1. Discover: Inventory all assets across the network and identify host details including operating system and open services to identify vulnerabilities. Develop a network baseline. Identify security vulnerabilities on a regular automated schedule.<br>
<br>
2. Prioritize Assets: Categorize assets into groups or business units, and assign a business value to asset groups based on their criticality to your business operation.<br>
<br>
3. Assess: Determine a baseline risk profile so you can eliminate risks based on asset criticality, vulnerability threat, and asset classification.<br>
<br>
4. Report: Measure the level of business risk associated with your assets according to your security policies. Document a security plan, monitor suspicious activity, and describe known vulnerabilities.<br>
<br>
5. Remediate: Prioritize and fix vulnerabilities in order according to business risk. Establish controls and demonstrate progress.<br>
<br>
6. Verify: Verify that threats have been eliminated through follow-up audits.<br>
<h2>Why Vulnerabilty Management is Important:</h2>
The purpose of a vulnerability management program is to keep your network safe from known exploitations and ensure it stays compliant with any regulatory requirements. It does this by analyzing your network for any incompatibilities, missed updates and common weaknesses within the software you use. It then prioritizes any vulnerabilities for remediation. A vulnerability management program protects your business network from being breached through well-known vulnerabilities, making it much harder for cybercriminals to target your company.<br>
