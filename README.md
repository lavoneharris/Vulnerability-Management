<h2>Description</h2>
This Vulnerability Management Lab consist of using the web platform Nessus Essentials to monitor a Virtual Machine environment on Windows 8 & 10 system and performing both non-credentialed and credentialed vulnerability scans against the Windows 8 & 10 Virtual Machine Host. Once the Vulnerability Assessment is complete on the sandboxed network we will look to use the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle of Discover,Prioritize,Assess,Report,Remediate, and Verify to ensure there are no vulnerabilities by performing suggested Windows Updates.
<br />


<h2>What is Vulnerability Management:</h2>
Vulnerability management is the  practice of identifying, classifying, prioritizing, remediating, and mitigating software vulnerabilities. Vulnerability management is considered an essential part of both computer & network security.
<br />


<h2>Vulnerability Management Lifecycle:</h2>
1. Discover: Inventory all assets across the network and identify host details including operating system and open services to identify vulnerabilities. Develop a network baseline. Identify security vulnerabilities on a regular automated schedule.<br>
<br>
2. Prioritize Assets: Categorize assets into groups or business units, and assign a business value to asset groups based on their criticality to your business operation.<br>
<br>
3. Assess: Determine a baseline risk profile so you can eliminate risks based on asset criticality, vulnerability threat, and asset classification.<br>
<br>
4. Report: Measure the level of business risk associated with your assets according to your security policies. Document a security plan, monitor suspicious activity, and describe known vulnerabilities.<br>
<br>
5. Remediate: Prioritize and fix vulnerabilities in order according to business risk. Establish controls and demonstrate progress.<br>
<br>
6. Verify: Verify that threats have been eliminated through follow-up audits.<br>


<h2>Why Vulnerability Management is Important:</h2>
The purpose of a vulnerability management program is to keep your network safe from known exploitations and ensure it stays compliant with any regulatory requirements. It does this by analyzing your network for any incompatibilities, missed updates and common weaknesses within the software you use. It then prioritizes any vulnerabilities for remediation. A vulnerability management program protects your business network from being breached through well-known vulnerabilities, making it much harder for cybercriminals to target your company.<br>

 <h1>Create Basic Scan In Nessus with Credntials (Will allow Nessus Scanner to into VM more deeply to scan for vulnerabilites) </h1>
 <br />
<br />
We will need to Setup our Windows 8 VM to be able to accept authenticated scans
 <br />
<br />
1. Go to Services on the Window 8 VM and enable Remote Registry by clicking properites -> start type: automatic -> OK

<br />
<br />
3. Set User Account Controls to Never Notify
<img src="https://imgur.com/RBDYkv9.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
4. To Regristy Editor by using the Windows Button + R and enter regedit -> OK
<img src="https://imgur.com/Dhyd1CA.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
5. In Registry Editor go to the Directory Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\WINDOWS\CURRENTVERSION\POLICIES\SYSTEM
<img src="https://imgur.com/i7Xt50E.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
6. Right Click -> New DWORD 32 BIT Value and Name it "LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy"

<img src="https://imgur.com/qJEwSSU.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
7. Left Click on LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy and select modify and change the Value from 0 to 1
<img src="https://imgur.com/GCHg6v5.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
8. Reboot the Windows 8 VM
<img src="https://imgur.com/bUAf0zH.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
9. Now that is complete go to your orginal Nessus Scanner Job Check Mark the Job and go to More -> Configure
 <img src="https://imgur.com/xibuViz.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
10. Go the Crendentials Tab -> Windows and Enter your VM credentials -> SAVE

<br />
11. Run the Scan job again
<img src="https://imgur.com/jUGXWWC.png.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
12. Note that this Time the scan ran and we now have a total of 26 Vulnerabilites Most Important According to the VPR5 Top Threats 1 critical, 3 medium.

<h2> Final Scan with a Depricated Version of Mozilla Firefox installed on the VM </h2>
1. In your VM if you search Old Version of Firefox in your web Browser. Download a outdated version of firefox mine was from October of 2015.  IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU GET THE OLD VERSION OF FIREFOX FROM MOZILLA AS THE PICTURE
<img src="https://imgur.com/ojt3rim.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
2. Run the installer for FireFox 
<img src="https://imgur.com/rcQSynW.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
3. Go Back to the Nessus Scanner and Run Once More 
<img src="https://imgur.com/jUGXWWC.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
4. In Running the Scan, we see the scanner picked up no new vulnerbilites as the total remained at 26. This could be a cause for concern or maybe the vulnerabilites were addressed by Firefox.

<br />
<br />
<h2> Remediation  </h2>
For these Windows 8 Vulnerabilites are quite simple as most of the suggestions from Nesus was to these vulnerbilietes was to update our Windows 8 patches. As you see since this is a fresh install of Windows 8 there is a laundry list of Updates (Important, Recommended, and Optional) That should be applied once that is complete the list iof vulnerabiltes discovered by Nessus will decrease. You can check this by rerunning the scan.
